Proposed algorithm for knowledge base embedding

The proposed algorithm improves over the existing algorithm of TransE (https://github.com/glorotxa/SME), and uses the same set of datasets for the model performance comparison. The code is also greatly motivated by the author's transE code on github and similarly the package Theano is needed to perform training and evaluation.
